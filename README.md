# ou-walking-club-app
A project I completed at the Open University in 2021 to design an admin app for a walking club

This involved creating wireframes for multiple pages the admin app would have, allowing the club's administrators to use the app to view club member details, create new events, review events proposed by members and send email announcements to the club's members. I also created a prototype page using HTML and CSS files for the announcements page, and later added in CSS to make this page responsive to mobile devices.
